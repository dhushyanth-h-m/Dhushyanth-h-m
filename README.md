# Hey there, I'm Dhushyanth! 🚀

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I’m a Software Engineer with a knack for building systems that are fast, secure, and user-friendly. I’ve got a Master’s in Computer Engineering from UT Arlington, and I’m all about diving deep into code—whether it’s crafting mobile apps, tinkering with kernel modules, or optimizing cloud pipelines. Let’s build something awesome together!

- **Currently**: Crafting cool stuff at The Soco App Corp
- **Passion**: Turning complex problems into elegant solutions
- **Fun Fact**: I can debug code faster than I can brew coffee (and I’m pretty quick with a coffee maker!)

## What Drives Me

I’m fascinated by how technology can transform lives. From speeding up Bluetooth connections for a social app to designing real-time packet sniffers, I love the thrill of pushing boundaries. My journey has taken me from low-level system programming to high-flying cloud architectures, and I’m always learning something new. Got a challenging idea? I’m game!

## My Tech Toolbox 🛠️

Here’s a peek at the tools and tech I wield to bring ideas to life:

- **Languages I Speak**: C++, Python, Swift, Java, JavaScript (and a few more!)
- **Cloud & DevOps Magic**: AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions
- **Data Wrangling**: PostgreSQL, Firebase Firestore, MySQL
- **Frameworks & More**: TensorFlow, Spark, JIRA, and a love for Agile workflows
- **Superpower**: Optimizing systems for speed and scale

## Cool Things I’ve Built

Here are a few projects I’m proud of. Check them out and let me know what you think!

- **Packet Processing Beast**: A C++ packet sniffer that chews through over a million packets per second. I optimized it with zero-copy buffers to keep CPU usage low even under crazy network loads. Real-time analysis? Nailed it!
- **Elevator System on Steroids**: A multi-threaded simulation in C++ that manages thousands of requests without breaking a sweat. Bonus: It’s hooked up with PostgreSQL and GitHub Actions for seamless updates.
- **Kernel-Level Network Wizardry**: A Linux kernel module for filtering TCP packets at lightning speed. I fine-tuned it to handle half a million packets per second with minimal latency.

## What’s Next?

I’m currently exploring the intersection of AI and system performance—think machine learning models that optimize real-time systems. I’m also open to collaborating on open-source projects or just geeking out over the latest tech trends. If you’ve got an idea or a project, hit me up!

## Let’s Connect! 🌐

I’d love to chat about software engineering, AI, or even the best debugging horror stories. Drop me a message or follow me for updates on my latest experiments.
